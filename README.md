# Flower Recognition System

The **Flower Recognition System** is a machine learning-based project designed to identify and classify different types of flowers from images. This repository primarily utilizes Jupyter Notebooks and Python for development and analysis.

## Features

- **Image Processing**: Pre-processes flower images for optimal classification.
- **Machine Learning**: Employs a trained model for flower recognition and classification.
- **Interactive Notebooks**: Contains Jupyter Notebooks for step-by-step implementation and experimentation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Devil-svg-hub/flower-recogintion-system.git
   cd flower-recogintion-system
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebooks:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Explore the provided notebooks to preprocess data, train the model, and classify flower images.

## Dataset

- The dataset used for training and testing consists of flower images. You can use your own dataset or download public datasets for flower classification.
- Ensure the dataset is placed in the `datasets/` directory.
